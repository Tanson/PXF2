The PixHawk Fire Cape 2.0 (PXF 2.0) is an open hardware multi-platform shield for making drones using the APM autopilot supported by the Dronecode Foundation. This board is the evolution of the PXF, a project initiated by Philip Rowse to create an open hardware daughter board for Linux-based autopilots.

The shield is compatible with the following boards:

- BeagleBone Black
- Raspberry Pi
- Raspberry Pi 2
- Banana Pi
- Orange Pi
- Odroid-C1
- Odroid-C1+

(Note: not all these boards have been tested experimentally but the shield offers compatibility with the corresponding headers)
